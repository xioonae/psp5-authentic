/* psp5 authentic – the PSP's own H.264 decoder (on the Media Engine) for a CAVLC stream: the way PMPlayer Ultraviolet (cooleyes' player, GPL) reaches it. None of that player's code is here, only what
 * can be read in it about the order and the structures of the calls.
 *
 * The decoder of the library sceMpeg that games load (mpeg.prx) does not take what this route needs: PMPlayer Ultraviolet loads the VSH's library (flash0:/kd/mpeg_vsh.prx) beside the AV codec
 * modules, starts the Media Engine with its Baseline image (meboot.h), opens the library in its mode 4 with 2 MB of the Engine's memory (the first 64 KB are the library's, the access unit lives at
 * +0x10000), and gives it the samples of the MP4 as they are in the file with sceMpegGetAvcNalAu; sceMpegAvcDecode, sceMpegAvcDecodeDetail2 and sceMpegBaseCscAvc then give the picture as RGB.
 * Every step writes a line to the log (hwavc_log): the first run on a PSP-1000 of a version that used the game's library stopped at sceMpegCreate (0x807f00ff).
 *
 * Only for a stream the PSP's decoder may take: in its Baseline mode a CAVLC stream without B pictures (unit.c hw_ok), in its Main mode a Main profile stream with CABAC or B pictures (hw_main); the Engine is
 * started with the image that fits (meboot.h) before hwavc_open(). video.c goes on with the software decoder (CAVLC) or the games' library (CABAC) when any step fails. */
