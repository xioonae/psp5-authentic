 *    left (a padding packet fills it);
 *  - a group of at most PS_TABLE_MAX units starts a sector, which has the system header and a "private stream 2" packet behind its pack header: the table of the size of every unit of the group, and
 *    in four numbers the sector (counted from this one) each of the first four units ends in. The PSP's library very likely cuts the units out of the stream by that table;
 *  - the PES packet of that first sector has both time stamps (of the first unit) and the P-STD extension; a PES packet later in the group has both time stamps (no extension) when a unit starts in
 *    it and at least PS_STAMP_EVERY units have started since the last stamp (they belong to the first unit that starts in the packet); every other one has none. */
