/* psp5 authentic – the timing the PSP's own H.264 streams have, written into a stream that has none.
 *
 * The PSP's sceMpeg library gets its pictures from streams made by Sony's tools. In those, the SPS has a VUI with timing and HRD parameters (NAL and VCL, the same), and every picture has a
 * "picture timing" SEI message (how long it waits to be decoded and to be shown), every key frame also a "buffering period" and a "recovery point" message. Streams without all that
 * (what x264 and other ordinary encoders make) froze the PSP or gave the decoder's fatal error. The PSP's XMB plays such files by another route (sceMp4), which does not need them.
 * Everything here is read off the PMF of PPSSPP's tests (see DEVELOPER-NOTES) and gives the same bytes as that stream has. */
