/* psp5 authentic – the look of the small things that are the same on every screen: the bars, the switches, the ticks, the buttons in the hints and the cards.
 * None of it depends on the theme: the theme is the background (psp5 authentic's `theme_backdrop`) and nothing else. The colours were read from the
 * maintainer's pictures of the console's own screens. Everything is drawn from the functions below (and the colours are used nowhere else), so the same thing
 * looks the same on every screen. `a` (0..1) fades it in and out. */
