/* psp5 authentic – the PSP's Media Engine firmware for the hardware video decoder.
 *
 * The decoder of the PSP's sceMpeg library runs on the Media Engine (the second processor) and the Engine is started with one of several firmware images, chosen by sceMeBootStart(type), a function of the
 * kernel's sceMeCore driver. The default image takes the streams of the PSP's own movies (CABAC) and answers the fatal error 0x80628002 to CAVLC (the maintainer's tests of a Baseline stream and of the
 * HandBrake PSP preset). PMPlayer Ultraviolet (cooleyes' player, GPL) starts the Engine with type 4 for a Baseline stream, 3 for a Main one and 1 for 720 x 480, before it opens the library, and its README
 * says Baseline streams with one reference frame play: that is the route this file opens for psp5 (video-opts.txt, "hw=1"). Nothing of that player's code is in psp5; only that fact is.
 *
 * sceMeBootStart is a kernel function: psp5 reaches it the way it reaches the volume of the OSD, through ARK's kubridge (kuKernelCall) and the address that systemctrl gives for a NID. It is never
 * called while a decoder of the Engine is open (the music is stopped before a video starts). */
