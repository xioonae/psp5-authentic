/* psp5 authentic – when a sample goes to the PSP's own decoder and when a picture is shown (the decisions of video.c's hw_step(), kept here without any call of the PSP so that they can be tested).
 *
 * The decoder is some samples behind (3 for a stream with 3 reference frames) and its pictures come in display order, so with B pictures not in the order of the samples, and sometimes two in one call.
 * So: the times of the samples that were given and have no picture yet wait in a set, and the picture that comes out is the one with the smallest of them; a sample is only given when no finished
 * picture is waiting for its time (the decoder runs as far ahead as it is behind); a picture is shown at its own time; the pictures before the place a jump asked for are not even converted; and at the
 * end, when the samples are used up and pictures are still inside the decoder, a key frame is given again (a decoder has to put out what it holds when a key frame starts a new sequence) until they are out. */
